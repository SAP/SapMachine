# This is the additional jtreg exclude list for SapMachine hotspot tests.
#
# List of tests that should not be run by test/Makefile, for various reasons:
#   1. Does not run with jtreg -samevm mode
#   2. Causes problems in jtreg -samevm mode for jtreg or tests that follow it
#   3. The test is too slow or consumes too many system resources
#   4. The test fails when run on any official build systems
#
# Tests marked @ignore are not run by test/Makefile, but harmless to be listed.
#
# List items are testnames followed by labels, all MUST BE commented
#   as to why they are here and use a label:
#     generic-all   Problems on all platforms
#     generic-ARCH  Where ARCH is one of: sparc, sparcv9, x64, i586, ppc64,
#                   ppc64le, s390x etc
#     OSNAME-all    Where OSNAME is one of: solaris, linux, windows, macosx, aix
#     OSNAME-ARCH   Specific on to one OSNAME and ARCH, e.g. solaris-amd64
#     OSNAME-REV    Specific on to one OSNAME and REV, e.g. solaris-5.8
#
# More than one label is allowed but must be on the same line comma seperated,
# without spaces!
# If there are several lines, the last one is used.
#
# SAP/SapMachine usage notes:
#
# This exclude list should be a vehicle only for temporary exclusions of tests
# or exclusions that are caused by infrastrucure specifics.
#
# Our first goal should be to fix test issues upstream or at least open
# upstream bugs and get the test excluded via the upstream exclusion lists.
#
# We have both internal exclude lists and exclude lists in the SapMachine
# repository. The internal lists are the master and the public lists in the
# SapMachine repository will be refreshed regularly, removing comments
# which reveal internal URLs, names or hostnames.
#
# The public SapMachine exclusion lists might contain additional test
# exclusions, specific to the SapMachine build and test infrastructure. That
# section needs to be placed at the end of the file.
