/**
 * A simple visitor of types with default behavior appropriate for the
 * {@link SourceVersion#RELEASE_9 RELEASE_9} and
 * {@link SourceVersion#RELEASE_10 RELEASE_10} source versions.
 *
 * Visit methods corresponding to {@code RELEASE_9} and earlier
 * language constructs call {@link #defaultAction defaultAction},
 * passing their arguments to {@code defaultAction}'s corresponding
 * parameters.
 *
 * <p> Methods in this class may be overridden subject to their
 * general contract.  Note that annotating methods in concrete
 * subclasses with {@link java.lang.Override @Override} will help
 * ensure that methods are overridden as intended.
 *
 * <p> <b>WARNING:</b> The {@code TypeVisitor} interface implemented
 * by this class may have methods added to it in the future to
 * accommodate new, currently unknown, language structures added to
 * future versions of the Java&trade; programming language.
 * Therefore, methods whose names begin with {@code "visit"} may be
 * added to this class in the future; to avoid incompatibilities,
 * classes which extend this class should not declare any instance
 * methods with names beginning with {@code "visit"}.
 *
 * <p>When such a new visit method is added, the default
 * implementation in this class will be to call the {@link
 * #visitUnknown visitUnknown} method.  A new simple type visitor
 * class will also be introduced to correspond to the new language
 * level; this visitor will have different default behavior for the
 * visit method in question.  When the new visitor is introduced, all
 * or portions of this visitor may be deprecated.
 *
 * @param <R> the return type of this visitor's methods.  Use {@link
 *            Void} for visitors that do not need to return results.
 * @param <P> the type of the additional parameter to this visitor's
 *            methods.  Use {@code Void} for visitors that do not need an
 *            additional parameter.
 *
 * @see SimpleTypeVisitor6
