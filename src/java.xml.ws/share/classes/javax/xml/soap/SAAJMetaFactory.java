/**
* The access point for the implementation classes of the factories defined in the
* SAAJ API. The {@code newInstance} methods defined on factories {@link SOAPFactory} and
* {@link MessageFactory} in SAAJ 1.4 defer to instances of this class to do the actual object creation.
* The implementations of {@code newInstance()} methods (in {@link SOAPFactory} and {@link MessageFactory})
* that existed in SAAJ 1.2 have been updated to also delegate to the SAAJMetaFactory when the SAAJ 1.2
* defined lookup fails to locate the Factory implementation class name.
*
* <p>
* SAAJMetaFactory is a service provider interface and it uses similar lookup mechanism as other SAAJ factories
* to get actual instance:
*
* <ul>
*  <li>If a system property with name {@code javax.xml.soap.SAAJMetaFactory} exists then its value is assumed
*  to be the fully qualified name of the implementation class. This phase of the look up enables per-JVM
*  override of the SAAJ implementation.
*  <li>If a system property with name {@code javax.xml.soap.MetaFactory} exists then its value is assumed
*  to be the fully qualified name of the implementation class. This property, defined by previous specifications
 * (up to 1.3), is still supported, but it is strongly recommended to migrate to new property
 * {@code javax.xml.soap.SAAJMetaFactory}.
*  <li>Use the configuration file "jaxm.properties". The file is in standard {@link java.util.Properties} format
*  and typically located in the {@code conf} directory of the Java installation. It contains the fully qualified
*  name of the implementation class with key {@code javax.xml.soap.SAAJMetaFactory}. If no such property is defined,
 * again, property with key {@code javax.xml.soap.MetaFactory} is used. It is strongly recommended to migrate to
 * new property {@code javax.xml.soap.SAAJMetaFactory}.
*  <li> Use the service-provider loading facilities, defined by the {@link java.util.ServiceLoader} class,
*  to attempt to locate and load an implementation of the service using the {@linkplain
*  java.util.ServiceLoader#load(java.lang.Class) default loading mechanism}.
*  <li> Finally, if all the steps above fail, platform default implementation is used.
* </ul>
*
* <p>
* There are no public methods on this
* class.
