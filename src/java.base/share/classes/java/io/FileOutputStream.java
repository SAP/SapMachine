/**
 * A file output stream is an output stream for writing data to a
 * <code>File</code> or to a <code>FileDescriptor</code>. Whether or not
 * a file is available or may be created depends upon the underlying
 * platform.  Some platforms, in particular, allow a file to be opened
 * for writing by only one {@code FileOutputStream} (or other
 * file-writing object) at a time.  In such situations the constructors in
 * this class will fail if the file involved is already open.
 *
 * <p><code>FileOutputStream</code> is meant for writing streams of raw bytes
 * such as image data. For writing streams of characters, consider using
 * <code>FileWriter</code>.
 *
 * @apiNote
 * To release resources used by this stream {@link #close} should be called
 * directly or by try-with-resources. Subclasses are responsible for the cleanup
 * of resources acquired by the subclass.
 * Subclasses that override {@link #finalize} in order to perform cleanup
 * should be modified to use alternative cleanup mechanisms such as
 * {@link java.lang.ref.Cleaner} and remove the overriding {@code finalize} method.
 *
 * @implSpec
 * If this FileOutputStream has been subclassed and the {@link #close}
 * method has been overridden, the {@link #close} method will be
 * called when the FileInputStream is unreachable.
 * Otherwise, it is implementation specific how the resource cleanup described in
 * {@link #close} is performed.
