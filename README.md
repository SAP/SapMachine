# [](#SapMachine) SapMachine
This project contains a downstream version of the [OpenJDK](http://openjdk.java.net/) project. It is used to build and maintain a SAP supported version of OpenJDK for SAP customers and partners who wish to use OpenJDK to run their applications.

We want to stress that this is clearly a "*friendly fork*". SAP is committed to ensuring the continued success of the Java platform:
* We are members of the [JCP Executive committee](https://jcp.org/en/participation/committee) since 2001 and recently served in the [JSR 379 (Java SE 9)](https://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=379) and [JSR 383 (Java SE 18.3)](https://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=383) Expert Groups. 
* SAP is among the [biggest external contributors](https://blogs.oracle.com/java-platform-group/building-jdk-11-together) to the OpenJDK project (currently leading the [PowerPC/AIX](http://openjdk.java.net/projects/ppc-aix-port/) and [s390](http://openjdk.java.net/projects/s390x-port/) porting projects).

* We intend to bring as many features as possible into the upstream project and keep the diff of this project as small as possible.
